# Bikesharing-Challenge
# Overview of the analysis
Fisrt step is to figure out how the bike-share business works out in NYC. From there, you'll create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.
## Purpose of the analysis
Use Pandas to change "tripduration" column from integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you'll create a set of visualizations to:
(1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
(2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
(3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
